/**
 * Filesystem paths cookiedclaw uses, plus the shared diagnostic log.
 *
 * Per-workspace philosophy: everything lives under the user's working
 * directory (the dir CC was launched from), not in $HOME. That way each
 * workspace is a self-contained agent — its own bot token, identity,
 * pairing list, attachments — and the workspace CLAUDE.md gets injected
 * by CC as the agent's system prompt automatically.
 *
 *   ./CLAUDE.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md  ← agent-visible
 *   ./.cookiedclaw/keys.env, access.json                       ← hidden state
 *   ./.cookiedclaw/inbox/<files>                                ← inbound attachments
 *   ./.cookiedclaw/cache/progress.{port,log}                    ← runtime cache
 *
 * Cache + inbox dirs are created lazily so a fresh workspace doesn't
 * crash the channel.
